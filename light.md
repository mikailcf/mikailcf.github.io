### Intro

This game project was made during the Programming Laboratory II course (the -link to castaway here- was made during Programming Laboratory I) back in 2010. It's the second course with the objective of showing the students what a bigger project looks like since most other courses are based on smaller, but by no means easier, programming exercises that focus on algorithms or problem solving.

The professor teaching the course at the time was specialized in computer vision and was very intered in augmented reality. With that he stabilished that all projects should ba based on AR and that people were free to make game projects if they wanted.
