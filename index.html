<p>This website is supposed to show some programming stuff I did. I'll think about what content exactly to put here and how to better present it. But for now there's only some things that I really <i>actually</i> did enjoy making, and that's a handful of college projects related to gaming.</p>

<p>My plan is to spend more time in personal projects and by doing so put more content here. But we'll see how well I'll be able to follow that plan.</p>

<p>Right now what you can do is take a look at some <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}projects/">stuff I've made</a>, you can read <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}about/">about me</a> or you can send me an <a href="mailto:contact@mikail.io" target="_top">e-mail</a>.</p>
