<p>This website is my portfolio of some programming stuff I did. I'll think about what content exactly to put here and how to better present it. For now there are only a few gaming-related projects, most of them I did for college.</p>

<p>My plan is to spend more time in personal projects and by doing so put more content in here. But we'll see how well I'll be able to follow that plan.</p>

<p>Right now what you can do is take a look at some <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}projects/">stuff I've made</a>, you can read <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}about/">about me</a> or you can send me an <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}contact/">e-mail</a>.</p>
