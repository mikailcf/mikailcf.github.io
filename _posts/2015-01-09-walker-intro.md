### Intro

The Computer Graphics course (I took it in 2012) was one of the courses that I've liked the most during college. The professor teching the course was known for believing that students learn more from assignments than from tests (something I also believe) so his assignments were harder and bigger compared to the ones from other professors.

For this project the teacher wanted us to learn how things worked beneath the curtain in OpenGL

In this project we had to model the outside of the buildings from our institute while implementing some techniques such as:

- changing the projection matrix for shadow rendering and orthographic rendering of text
- only rendering particles within an area around the camera
- skybox

I was programming solo in this project, and I've only used C++ with OpenGL, no third party libraries.

Some must-have features were:

- shadows
- rain with 3d raindrops
- a skybox
- display the frame rate

Some optional features (that I implemented) were:

- day and night cycle
- fog during the rain
- lightning bolts during the rain
- trees
- collision check
