Hi! I'm Mikail Campos Freitas!

I like to learn.</br>
I like challenges and the growth needed to overcome them. I like to get better at what I do and know.

I like to interact with people from different areas and learn about what they do, their work, their thought process. I think that by looking at problems from different points of view we learn to come up with better and more creative solutions for those _and_ future problemss.

I like to code and I like to think of solutions to problems. Those problems being from designing a better user interface for an app or thinking how to optmize an algorithm with heuristics.

I like reading, watching movies and a good story.</br>
I like gaming, and software and game development. I find the combination of technical and creative skills needed to make software that goes straight into the users' hands (such as apps or games) to be very enriching and very much rewarding.

After all that there's also the good ol' <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}mikail_cv.pdf">resume</a>.
